Thanks to Puppet, we were able to restore our infrastructure to normal operation in under 1H, pretty impressive. Imagine if we had to do everything manually: launching the servers, configuring and linking them, importing application code, starting every process, and obviously, fixing all the bugs (you should know by now that complicated infrastructure always goes sideways)
